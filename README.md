# Residential Management System 

> A Java-based mini project developed as part of the *Object-Oriented Programming* course.

This project demonstrates the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java by simulating a simple residential management system.

##  Features

-  Resident information management (add, update, delete, search)
-  Basic admin role structure
-  File-based data storage(dulieu.txt)

---

##  Technologies Used

- **Java SE** (Standard Edition)
- **Object-Oriented Programming** principles
- Java I/O (File handling)
- Simple console-based UI
- Using NetBeans GUI Designer
---

## ðŸ§  OOP Concepts Applied

This project helped me reinforce key OOP principles in Java:

- âœ… **Encapsulation** â€“ All classes maintain private fields with public getters/setters
- âœ… **Inheritance** â€“ Shared attributes across users/residents
- âœ… **Polymorphism** â€“ Method overriding for role-based behaviors
- âœ… **Abstraction** â€“ Abstract classes/interfaces for core logic
